# JS Prototype Flash Cards

## Abstract:
[//]: <>
I built a terminal-based flashcards application that allows the user to cycle through JS Prototype-related questions, ultimately delivering their score at the end of the round. The goal of this project was to use TDD (Test Driven Development) to write tests using Mocha/Chai, and then create class-functionality to successfully pass those tests.

## Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> 
1. Fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/jfogiato/flashcards)
1. Copy the SSH key from the green "Code" button within the repo.
1. In your terminal, use the command `git clone git@github.com:[the link to your repo]`.
1. Open the repo in your text editor to make any changes or inspect code.
1. Use `node index.js` to open the app in your terminal.

## Context:
[//]: <> 
This project was the first solo project of Mod 2 at Turing. We were given an overview of what the application was intended to do, as well as a dataset and files to enable our application to run in the terminal. From there, we were tasked with building out classes and class tests to test functionality without running the application. This project took about 4 hours to complete.

## Learning Goals:
[//]: <> 
The goal of this project was to utilize TDD to write unit & class-to-class tests prior to actually writing functional code.
